I am a first-year PhD student at the joint UC Berkeley & UCSF Bioengineering PhD program interested in understanding principles of human and animal intelligence. I am supported by Asan Foundation Biomedical Science Scholarship. I am currently rotating labs to find my thesis lab.

Before this, I served at the Republic of Korea Army as an intelligent robot researcher. I worked with Beomjoon Kim from KAIST AI department to invent a robotic object search algorithm that can efficiently search a target object. Before that, I got MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from Georgia Tech. I studied systems and computational neuroscience advised by Prof. Bilal Haider. During my Master's, I studied how a new type of gamma oscillation affects visual processing. Also, I got BS in ECE from KAIST-Georgia Tech dual-degree program focusing on digital signal processing (DSP). During so, I was a DSP research scientist intern at Samsung Research America Think Tank Team where I developed a robotic perception algorithm.
