I am a first-year PhD student at the [joint UC Berkeley & UCSF Bioengineering PhD program](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/) interested in understanding principles of human and animal intelligence. I am supported by [Asan Foundation Biomedical Science Scholarship](https://www.asanfoundation.or.kr/af/eng/main.do). I am currently rotating labs to find my thesis lab.

Before this, I served at the Republic of Korea Army as an intelligent robot researcher where I invented a robotic object search algorithm that can efficiently search a target object  with [Beomjoon Kim](https://beomjoonkim.github.io/) from KAIST AI department. Before that, I got MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from Georgia Tech. I studied system and computational neuroscience with [Bilal Haider](https://haider.gatech.edu/). During my Master's, I studied how a new type of gamma oscillation affects visual processing. Also, I got BS in ECE from KAIST-Georgia Tech dual-degree program focusing on digital signal processing (DSP). During so, I was a DSP research scientist intern at [Samsung Research America Think Tank Team](https://thinktankteam.info/) where I developed a robotic perception algorithm.
